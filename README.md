Advent of Code 2018 solutions

2018 was the first year I've joined Advent of Code, and used C and
Python for the solutions, learning the depths of Python on the way. 
These codes (found in py_c directory) are not cleaned up.

After the contest I've learned Ruby, and rewritten a few solutions,
these programs are in the main directory.
